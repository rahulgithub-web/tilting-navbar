        <p>
          I've been coding for over 6 months now. As of now I'am willing and
          excited to work with both startups and large corporations to build &
          scale their companies. Along the journey I realised my passion existed
          in helping and pursue my dreams as upcoming developers. With this
          passion, as of now I have done some projects related to HTML5, CSS3,
          Javascript and Reactjs. I will deliver REAL VALUE by giving my best to
          the projects and solves the problems that will help me to enter the
          world of web development. I am also known for quick typing skills,
          razor-sharp eye for detail...
